SCV

This project is to automate the hardware decision when building a computer given a budget.

It will find the optimal hardware set for the given budget.
Optimal being defined as highest possible fps when playing most games.

This is intended to replace the many long tutorials on what hardware to buy and any potential mistakes people make when choosing their hardware.
This is also meant to be self-maintainable such that it is always relevant.

It will not be perfect.
It cannot satisfy subjective things (such as appearance of case).
It will not automatically maintain with extreme technology changes (see: cpu merging with mobo).
It will not have any bias on branding.
